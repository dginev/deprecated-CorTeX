A \emph{truth function} is a function that returns one of two values, one of which is interpreted as ``true,'' and the other which is interpreted as ``false''.  Typically either ``T'' and ``F'' are used, or ``1'' and ``0'', respectively.  Using the latter, we can write $$f : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$$
defines a truth function $f$. That is, $f$ is a mapping from any number ($n$) of true/false (0 or 1) values to a single value, which is 0 or 1.
