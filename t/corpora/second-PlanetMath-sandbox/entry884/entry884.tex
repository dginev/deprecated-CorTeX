The Lagrange multiplier method is used when one needs to find the extreme or stationary points of a function on a set which is a subset of the domain.

{\bf Method}

Suppose that $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g_{i}(\mathbf{x}), i=1,...,m$ ($\mathbf{x}\in \R^n$) are differentiable functions that map $\R^n \mapsto \R$, and we want to solve 
$$\min f(\mathbf{x}), \max f(\mathbf{x})\quad\mbox{such that}\quad g_{i}(\mathbf{x})=0,\quad i=1,\ldots,m$$

By a calculus theorem, if the constaints are independent, the gradient of $f$, $\nabla f$, must satisfy the following equation at the stationary points:

$$\nabla f = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_{i} \nabla g_{i}$$

The constraints are said to be independent iff all the gradients of each constraint are linearly independent, that is:

$\left \{\nabla g_{1}(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \nabla g_{m}(\mathbf{x})\right \}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors on all points where the constraints are verified.


Note that this is equivalent to finding the stationary points of:

$$f(\mathbf{x})-\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_{i}( g_{i}(\mathbf{x}))$$

for $\mathbf{x}$ in the domain and the \emph{Lagrange multipliers} $\lambda_{i}$ without restrictions.

After finding those points, one applies the $g_i$ constraints to get the actual stationary points subject to the constraints.
