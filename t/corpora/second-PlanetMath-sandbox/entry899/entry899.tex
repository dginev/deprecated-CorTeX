A bilinear form $B$ over a vector space $V$ is said to be {\em non-degenerate} when
\begin{itemize}
\item if $B({{\bf x}},{{\bf y}}) = 0$ for all ${{\bf x}} \in V$, then ${{\bf y}} = {{\bf 0}}$, and
\item if $B({{\bf x}},{{\bf y}}) = 0$ for all ${{\bf y}} \in V$, then ${{\bf x}} = {{\bf 0}}$.
\end{itemize}
