A \emph{well-ordered} set is a totally ordered set in which every nonempty subset has a least member.

An example of well-ordered set is the set of positive integers with the standard order relation $(\mathbbmss{Z}^+,<)$, because any nonempty subset of it has least member. However,  $\mathbbmss{R}^+$ (the positive reals) is not a well-ordered set with the usual order, because $(0,1)=\{x:0<x<1\}$ is a nonempty subset but it doesn't contain a least number.

A \textbf{well-ordering} of a set $X$ is the result of defining a binary relation $\leq$ on $X$ to itself in such a way that $X$ becomes well-ordered with respect to $\leq$.
