\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a finite group whose order is divisible by the prime $p$. Suppose $p^m$ is the highest power of $p$ which is a factor of $|G|$ and set $$k = \frac{|G|}{p^m}.$$ Then

\begin{enumerate}
\item the group $G$ contains at least one subgroup of order $p^m$,
\item any two subgroups of $G$ of order $p^m$ are conjugate, and
\item the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $p^m$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $p$ and is a factor of $k$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
