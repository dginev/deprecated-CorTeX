\begin{document}
A \emph{principal ideal domain} is an integral domain where every
ideal is a principal ideal.

In a PID, an ideal $(p)$ is maximal if and only if $p$ is irreducible
(and prime since \PMlinkname{any PID is also a UFD}{PIDsAreUFDs}).

Note that subrings of PIDs are not necessarily PIDs.  (There is
an example of this within the entry biquadratic field.)
