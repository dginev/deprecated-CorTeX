Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.
If there are injections $S \to T$ and $T \to S$,
then there is a bijection $S\to T$.

The Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem is useful
for proving many results about cardinality,
since it replaces one hard problem (finding a bijection between $S$ and $T$)
with two generally easier problems (finding two injections).
