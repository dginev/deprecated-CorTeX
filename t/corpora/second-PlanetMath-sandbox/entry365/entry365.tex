\section*{Introduction}

When defining a measure for a set $E$
we usually cannot hope to make every subset of $E$ measurable.
Instead we must usually restrict our attention
to a specific collection of subsets of $E$,
requiring that this collection be closed under operations
that we would expect to preserve measurability.
A $\sigma$-algebra is such a collection.

\section*{Definition}

Given a set $E$, a \emph{$\sigma$-algebra} in $E$
is a collection $\F$ of subsets of $E$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\emptyset\in\F$.
\item Any union of countably many elements of $\F$
      is an element of $\F$.
\item The complement of any element of $\F$ in $E$
      is an element of $\F$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Notes}

It follows from the definition that any $\sigma$-algebra $\F$ in $E$
also satisfies the properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E\in\F$.
\item Any intersection of countably many elements of $\F$
      is an element of $\F$.
\end{itemize}

Note that a $\sigma$-algebra is a field of sets
that is closed under countable unions and countable intersections
(rather than just finite unions and finite intersections).

Given any collection $C$ of subsets of $E$,
the $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(C)$ \emph{generated by} $C$
is defined to be the smallest $\sigma$-algebra in $E$
such that $C\subseteq \sigma(C)$.
This is well-defined,
as the intersection of any non-empty collection of $\sigma$-algebras in $E$
is also a $\sigma$-algebra in $E$.

\section*{Examples}

For any set $E$, 
the power set $\powerset{E}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra in $E$,
as is the set $\{\emptyset,E\}$.

A more interesting example is the 
\PMlinkname{Borel $\sigma$-algebra}{BorelSigmaAlgebra} in $\R$,
which is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open subsets of $\R$,
or, equivalently,
the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the compact subsets of $\R$.
