\begin{document}
A bilinear form $B$ on a real or complex vector space $V$ is {\em positive definite} if $B(x,x) > 0$ for all nonzero vectors $x \in V$. On the other hand, if $B(x,x) < 0$ for all nonzero vectors $x \in V$, then we say $B$ is {\em negative definite}. If $B(x,x) \ge 0$ for all vectors $x \in V$, then we say 
   $B$ is {\em nonnegative definite}. Likewise, 
if $B(x,x) \le 0$ for all vectors $x \in V$, then we say 
   $B$ is {\em nonpositive definite}.

A form which is neither positive definite nor negative definite is called {\em indefinite}.
