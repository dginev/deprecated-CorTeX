A \emph{graph} $G$ is an ordered pair of disjoint sets $(V, E)$ such that $E$ is a subset of the set $V^{(2)}$ of unordered pairs of $V$. $V$ and $E$ are always assumed to be finite, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The set $V$ is the set of \emph{vertices} (sometimes called nodes) and $E$ is the set of \emph{edges}. If $G$ is a graph, then $V = V(G)$ is the vertex set of $G$, and $E = E(G)$ is the edge set.
Typically, $V(G)$ is defined to be nonempty. If $x$ is a vertex of $G$, we sometimes write $x \in G$ instead of $x \in V(G)$.

An edge $\{x, y\}$ (with $x\neq y$) is said to \emph{join} the vertices $x$ and $y$ and is denoted by $xy$. One says that the edges $xy$ and $yx$ are \emph{equivalent}; the vertices $x$ and $y$ are the \emph{endvertices} of this edge. If $xy \in E(G)$, then $x$ and $y$ are \emph{adjacent}, or \emph{neighboring}, vertices of $G$, and the vertices $x$ and $y$ are \emph{incident} with the edge $xy$. Two edges are \emph{adjacent} if they have at least one common endvertex. Also, $x \sim y$ means that the vertex $x$ is adjacent to the vertex $y$.

Notice that this definition allows pairs of the form $\{x,x\}$, which would correspond to a node joining to itself.  Some authors explicitly disallow this in their definition of a graph.

Note:  Some authors include multigraphs in their definition of a graph.  In this notation, the above definition corresponds to that of a \emph{simple graph}.  A graph is then \emph{simple} if there is at most one edge joining each pair of nodes.
