\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a topological space.  Define a relation $\sim$ on $X$ as follows:  $x\sim y$ if there is no partition of $X$ into disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \cup V=X$, $x\in U$ and $y\in V$.

This is an equivalence relation on $X$.  The equivalence classes are called the \emph{quasicomponents} of $X$.
