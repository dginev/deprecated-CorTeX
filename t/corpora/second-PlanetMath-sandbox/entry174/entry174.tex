\begin{document}
A nonzero ring $R$ is said to be a {\it simple ring} if it has no (two-sided) ideal other then the zero ideal and $R$ itself.
\par
This is equivalent to saying that the zero ideal is a maximal ideal.
\par
If $R$ is a commutative ring with unit, then this is equivalent to being a field.
