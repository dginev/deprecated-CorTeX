Let $T\colon V\to W$ be a linear mapping between vector spaces.

The set of all vectors in $V$ that $T$ maps to $0$
is called the \emph{kernel} (or \emph{nullspace}) of $T$,
and is denoted $\ker T$. So
\[
  \ker T = \{\, x \in V\mid T(x)=0\,\}.
\]

The kernel is a vector subspace of $V$,
and its \PMlinkname{dimension}{Dimension2} is called the nullity of $T$.

The function $T$ is injective if and only if $\ker T=\{0\}$
(see the \PMlinkname{attached proof}{OperatornamekerL0IfAndOnlyIfLIsInjective}).
In particular, if the dimensions of $V$ and $W$ are equal and finite,
then $T$ is invertible if and only if $\ker T=\{0\}$.

If $U$ is a vector subspace of $V$, then we have
\[
  \ker T|_U = U \cap \ker T,
\]
where $T|_U$ is
the \PMlinkname{restriction}{RestrictionOfAFunction} of $T$ to $U$.

When the linear mappings are given by means of matrices,
the kernel of the matrix $A$ is
\[
  \ker A=\{\,x\in V \mid Ax=0\,\}.
\]
