\begin{document}
Let $R$ be a ring, and let $A$ and $B$ be left (right) ideals of $R$.  Then the {\it product} of the ideals $A$ and $B$, which we denote $AB$, is the left (right) ideal generated by all products $ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.  Note that since sums of products of the form $ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ are contained simultaneously in both $A$ and $B$, we have $AB\subset A\cap B$.
