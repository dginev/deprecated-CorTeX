\begin{document}
 An  $n\times n$ matrix $A$   that contains an $s \times (n-s)$ zero submatrix for some positive integer $s$ is said to be {\it partly decomposable}. If no such submatrix exists then $A$
is said to be \emph{ it fully  indecomposable}. 
By convention, a $1 \times 1$ matrix is fully indecomposable if it is nonzero.
$A$ is {\it nearly decomposable} if it fully indecomposable but whenever a nonzero  entry is changed to 0 the resulting matrix is partly decomposable.
