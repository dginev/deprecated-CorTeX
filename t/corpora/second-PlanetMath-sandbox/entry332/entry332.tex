\begin{document}
A scalar is a quantity that is invariant under coordinate transformation, also known as a tensor of rank 0. For example, the number 1 is a scalar, so is any number or variable $n\in\mathbb{R}$. The point $(3,4)$ is not a scalar because it is variable under rotation.
As such, a scalar can be an element of a field over which a vector space is defined.
