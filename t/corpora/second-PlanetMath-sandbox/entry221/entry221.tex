\begin{document}
For any natural number $n$, there does not exist a bijection between $n$ and a proper subset of $n$.

The name of the theorem is based upon the observation that pigeons will not occupy a pigeonhole that already contains a pigeon, so there is no way to fit $n$ pigeons in fewer than $n$ pigeonholes.
