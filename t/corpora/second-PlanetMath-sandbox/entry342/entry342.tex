\begin{document}
The regular elements of a finite commutative ring $R$ are the units of the ring (see the \PMlinkname{parent}{NonZeroDivisorsOfFiniteRing} of this entry). \,Generally, the largest overring of $R$, the total ring of fractions $T$, is obtained by forming $S^{-1}R$, the extension by localization, using as the multiplicative set $S$ the set of all regular elements, which in this case is the unit group of $R$. \,The ring $R$ may be considered as a subring of $T$, which consists formally of the fractions \,$\frac{a}{s} = as^{-1}$\, with \,$a\in R$\, and \,$s\in S$. \,Since every $s$ has its own group inverse $s^{-1}$ in $S$ and so in $R$, it's evident that $T$ \PMlinkescapetext{contains} no other elements than the elements of $R$. \,Consequently, \,$T = R$,\, and therefore also any overring of $R$ coincides with $R$.

Accordingly, one can not extend a finite commutative ring by using a localization. \,Possible extensions must be made via some kind of \PMlinkname{adjunction}{RingAdjunction}. \,A more known special case is a \PMlinkname{finite integral domain}{AFiniteIntegralDomainIsAField} --- it is always a field and thus closed under the divisions.
