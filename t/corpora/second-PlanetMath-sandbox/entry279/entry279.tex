\PMlinkescapeword{domain}

A \emph{region} is a nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{C}$.  Note that this definition is a \PMlinkescapetext{restriction} of that of \PMlinkname{domain}{Domain2} (as defined in complex analysis) to the complex plane.  Some people prefer to use ``region'' instead of ``domain'' to avoid confusion with other mathematical definitions of domain.  (The set theoretic definition of \PMlinkname{domain}{Domain} is also used in complex analysis.)

Regions play a major role in complex analysis since every nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ is the union of countably many connected components, each of which is a region.
