\begin{document}
The \emph{centroid} of a triangle (also called \emph{center of gravity} of 
the triangle) is the point where the three medians intersect each other.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{centroid}
\end{center}

In the figure, $AA', BB'$ and $CC'$ are medians and $G$ is the centroid of $ABC$.
The centroid $G$ has the property that divides the medians in the ratio $2:1$, that is 
$$AG=2GA'\quad BG=2GB'\quad CG=2GC'.$$
