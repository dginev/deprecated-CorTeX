\begin{document}
A \emph{regular polyhedron} is a polyhedron such that
\begin{itemize}
\item Every face is a regular polygon.
\item On each vertex, the same number of edges concur.
\item The dihedral angle between any two faces is always the same.
\end{itemize}

These polyhedra are also known as Platonic solids, since Plato described them in his work. There are only 5 regular polyhedra, as was first shown by Theaetetus, one of Plato's students. Some sources ascribe to Theaetetus also the discovery of the dodecahedron. 

The five solids are:
\begin{description}
\item[Regular Tetrahedron] It has 6 edges and 4 vertices and 4 faces, each one being an equilateral triangle. Its symmetry group is $S_4$.
\item[Regular Hexahedron] Also known as cube. It has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces each one being a square. Its symmetry group is $S_4\times C_2$.
\item[Regular Octahedron] It has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces, each one being an equilateral triangle Its symmetry group is $S_4\times C_2$.
\item[Regular Dodecahedron] It has 20 vertices, 30 edges and 12 faces, each one being a regular pentagon. Its symmetry group is $A_5\times C_2$.
\item[Regular Icosahedron] It has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 faces, each one being an equilateral triangle. Its symmetry group is $A_5\times C_2$.
\end{description}

\small Note: $A_n$ is the alternating group of order $n$, $S_n$ is the symmetric group of order $n$ and $C_n$ is the cyclic group with order $n$.
