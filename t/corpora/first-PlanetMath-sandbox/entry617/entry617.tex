\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a group, $X$ a set, and $\cdot: G \times X \longrightarrow X$ a group action. For any subset $S$ of $X$, the {\em stabilizer} of $S$, denoted $\operatorname{Stab}(S)$, is the subgroup
$$
\operatorname{Stab}(S) := \{g \in G \mid g\cdot s \in S \text{for all }\ s \in S\}.
$$
The stabilizer of a single point $x$ in $X$ is often denoted $G_x$.
