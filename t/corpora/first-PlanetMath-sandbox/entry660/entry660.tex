\begin{document}
A \emph{perfect ruler} of length $n$ is a ruler with a subset of the integer markings  $\{0,a_2,\ldots,n\}\subset\{0,1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that appear on a regular ruler.  The defining criterion of this subset is that there exists an $m$ such that any positive integer $k\leq m$ can be expresses uniquely as a difference $k=a_i-a_j$ for some $i,j$.  This is referred to as an \emph{$m$-perfect ruler}.

A 4-perfect ruler of length $7$ is given by $\{0,1,3,7\}$.  To verify this, we need to show that every number $1,2,\ldots,4$ can be expressed as a difference of two numbers in the above set:

\begin{align*}
1&=1-0\\
2&=3-1\\
3&=3-0\\
4&=7-3\\
\end{align*}

An optimal perfect ruler is one where for a fixed value of $n$ the value of $a_n$ is minimized.
