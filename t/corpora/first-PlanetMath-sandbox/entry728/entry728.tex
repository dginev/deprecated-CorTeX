\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a group, $H \subset G$ a subgroup, and $V$ a representation of $H$, considered as a $\mathbb{Z}[H]$--module. The {\em induced representation} of $\rho$ on $G$, denoted $\operatorname{Ind}_H^G(V)$, is the $\mathbb{Z}[G]$--module whose underlying vector space is the direct sum
$$
\bigoplus_{\sigma \in G/H} \sigma V
$$
of formal translates of $V$ by left cosets $\sigma$ in $G/H$, and whose multiplication operation is defined by choosing a set $\{g_\sigma\}_{\sigma \in G/H}$ of coset representatives and setting
$$
g(\sigma v) := \tau (h v)
$$
where $\tau$ is the unique left coset of $G/H$ containing $g \cdot g_\sigma$ (i.e., such that $g \cdot g_\sigma = g_\tau \cdot h$ for some $h \in H$).

One easily verifies that the representation $\operatorname{Ind}_H^G(V)$ is independent of the choice of coset representatives $\{g_\sigma\}$.
