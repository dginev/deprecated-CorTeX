\begin{document}
The \emph{complete graph} with $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, contains all possible edges; that is, any two vertices are adjacent.

The complete graph of $4$ vertices, or $K_4$ looks like this:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{k4.eps}
\end{center}

The number of edges in $K_n$ is the $n-1$th triangular number.  Every vertex in $K_n$ has degree $n-1$; therefore $K_n$ has an Euler circuit if and only if $n$ is odd.  A complete graph always has a Hamiltonian path, and the chromatic number of $K_n$ is always $n$.
