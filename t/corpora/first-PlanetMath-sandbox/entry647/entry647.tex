\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a topological space.  $X$ is said to be \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{completely normal}} if whenever $A,B\subseteq X$ with $A\cap\overline{B}=\overline{A}\cap B=\emptyset$, then there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq V$.

Equivalently, a topological space $X$ is \PMlinkescapetext{completely normal} if and only if every subspace is normal.
