\begin{thm}
Let $f \in \mathbb{C}[Z]$ be a non-constant polynomial.  Then there is a $z\in\mathbb{C}$ with $f(z)=0$.
\end{thm}

In other \PMlinkescapetext{words}, $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed.

As a corollary, a non-constant polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[Z]$ factors completely
into linear factors.
