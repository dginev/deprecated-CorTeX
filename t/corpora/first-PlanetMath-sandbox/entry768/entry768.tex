Let $L$ be a context-free language (a.k.a. type 2 language).  Then there exist
two integers $m$ and $n$ such that, if the length of a word $W$ is greater
than $m$, then $W = ABCDE$ where $A,B,C,D,E$ are subwords such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item The length of the subword $BCD$ is less than $n$.
\item $BD$ is not be empty.
\item For all integers $k > 0$, it is the case that $AB^kCD^kE$ belongs to $L$,
where exponentiation denotes repetition of a subword $k$ times.
\end{enumerate}

An important use of this lemma is that it allows one to show that a language
is not context-free. (Remember, just because a language happens to be described 
in terms of a context-sensitive grammar does not automatically preclude the
possibility of describing the same language also  by a 
context-free language.)  The idea is to assume that the language is
context-free, then arrive at a contradiction via this lemma.

As an illustrative example, consider the following language, which consists of
but one terminal symbol, `x' and which consists of all strings of `x' 's whose
length is a perfect square.  Were this a context-free language, there would 
exist integers $m$ and $n$ as above.  Choose an integer $h$ such that $h^2 > m$.
Then the word $x^{h^2}$ belongs to our language and the lemma tells us that
it can be written as $ABCDE$ so as to satisfy the conditions enumerated above.
Write $A = x^a$, $B = x^b$, $C = x^c$, $D = x^d$, $E = x^e$ for suitable nonnegative integers $a,b,c,d,e$.  Then we have $a + b + c + d + e = k^2$;
by condition , $b + d > 0$ and, by condition , $a + kb + c + kd + e$ would 
have to be a perfect square because $AB^kCD^kE$ would be a word of the
language.  This, however, leads to a contradiction: $h^2 + k (b + d)$ 
could not possibly be a perfect square for all $k$ unless $b + d = 0$.

As an exercise, the reader may consider constructing a context-sensitive
grammar for this language and posting it as an attachment to this entry 
(at which time this sentence will come down).
