\begin{document}
Let $(X, \borel, \mu)$ be a probability space, $f \in L^1(\mu)$, and $T\colon X \to X$ a measure preserving transformation.  Birkhoff's \emph{ergodic theorem} (often called the \emph{pointwise} or \emph{strong} ergodic theorem) states that there exists $f^*\in L^1(\mu)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(T^k x) = f^*(x)
\end{equation*}
for almost all $x\in X$. Moreover, $f^*$ is $T$-invariant (i.e., $f^*\circ T = f^*$) almost everywhere and $$\int f^*d\mu = \int f d\mu.$$ 
In particular, if $T$ is ergodic then the $T$-invariance of $f^*$ implies that it is constant almost everywhere, and so this constant must be the integral of $f^*$; that is, if $T$ is ergodic, then 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(T^k x) = \int fd\mu$$ 
for almost every $x$. This is often interpreted in the following way: for an ergodic transformation, the time average equals the space average almost surely.
