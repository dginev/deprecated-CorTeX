{\bf Aliasing}

Used in the context of processing digitized signals (e.g. audio) and images (e.g. video), aliasing describes the effect of undersampling during digitization which can generate a false (apparent) low frequency for signals, or staircase steps along edges in images (jaggies.) Aliasing can be avoided by an antialiasing (analogue) low-pass filter, before sampling. The term antialiasing is also in use for \emph{a posteriori} signal smoothing intended to remove the effect.
