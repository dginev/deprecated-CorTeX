\begin{document}
A field $K$ is \emph{algebraically closed} if every non-constant polynomial in $K[X]$ has a root in $K$.

An extension field $L$ of $K$ is an \emph{algebraic closure} of $K$ if $L$ is algebraically closed and every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$.  Using the axiom of choice, one can show that any field has an algebraic closure.  Moreover, any two algebraic closures of a field are isomorphic as fields, but not necessarily canonically isomorphic.
