\begin{document}
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional representation of a finite group $G$, and let $W$ be a representation of a subgroup $H \subset G$. Then the characters of $V$ and $W$ satisfy the inner product relation
$$
(\chi_{\Ind(W)}, \chi_V) = (\chi_W, \chi_{\Res(V)})
$$
where $\Ind$ and $\Res$ denote the induced representation $\Ind_H^G$ and the restriction representation $\Res_H^G$.

The Frobenius reciprocity theorem is often given in the stronger form which states  that $\Res$ and $\Ind$ are adjoint functors between the category of $G$--modules and the category of $H$--modules:
$$
\Hom_H(W, \Res(V)) = \Hom_G(\Ind(W),V),
$$
or, equivalently
$$
V \otimes \Ind(W) = \Ind(\Res(V) \otimes W).
$$
