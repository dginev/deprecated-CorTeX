A set $A$ is said to be \emph{Dedekind-infinite}
if there is an injective function $f\colon\omega\to A$,
where $\omega$ denotes the set of natural numbers.
A set that is not Dedekind-infinite is said to be \emph{Dedekind-finite}.

A Dedekind-infinite set is clearly infinite,
and in ZFC it can be shown that
a set is Dedekind-infinite if and only if it is infinite.

It is consistent with ZF that
there is an infinite set that is not Dedekind-infinite.
However, the existence of such a set requires the failure
not just of the full Axiom of Choice, but even of the Axiom of Countable Choice.
