\PMlinkescapeword{Hausdorff}

A topological space $X$ is said to be \emph{completely regular} if whenever $C\subseteq X$ is closed and $x\in X\setminus C$ then there is a continuous function $f\colon X\to[0,1]$ with $f(x)=0$ and $f(C)\subseteq\{1\}$.

A completely regular space that is also \PMlinkname{$T_0$}{T0Space} (and therefore \PMlinkname{Hausdorff}{T2Space})
is called a \emph{Tychonoff space}, or a \emph{$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$ space}.

Some authors interchange the meanings of `completely regular' and `$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$' compared to the above.

It can be proved that a topological space is Tychonoff
if and only if it has a Hausdorff compactification.
