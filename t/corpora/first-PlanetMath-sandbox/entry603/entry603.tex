Let $F$ be a finite field of characteristic $p$, and let $f$ and $g$ be distinct monic irreducible (non-constant) polynomials in the polynomial ring $F[X]$. Define the {\em Legendre symbol} $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)$ by
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) :=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{ if $f$ is a square in the quotient ring $F[X]/(g)$,} \\
-1 & \text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
The quadratic reciprocity theorem for polynomials over a finite field states that
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) \left(\frac{g}{f}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2} \deg(f) \deg(g)}.
$$
