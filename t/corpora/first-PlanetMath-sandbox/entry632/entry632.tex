\textbf{Definition}.
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories, and let 
$S,T:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ be covariant functors. Then suppose
that for every object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ one has a morphism 
$\eta_A :  S(A) \to T(A) $ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that for every morphism 
$\alpha: A \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ the following
$$
\xymatrix@+=4pc{S(A) \ar[d]_{S(\alpha)} \ar[r]^{\eta_A} & T(A) \ar[d]^{T(\alpha)} \\
S(B) \ar[r]^{\eta_{B}} & T(B)
}
$$

is \PMlinkname{commutative}{CommutativeDiagram}.  Then we variously write 
$$\eta: S \dot{\to} T \quad\mbox{ or }\quad \eta: S\Rightarrow T\quad \mbox{ or } \quad \eta:S\to T$$ and call $\eta$ a 
\emph{natural trasformation} from $S$ to $T$.

One may think of a natural transformation $\eta:S\to T$ as a `function' from the class of objects of $\mathcal{C}$ to the class of morphisms of $\mathcal{D}$.

As a first example, for every functor $S:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$, we can associate the natural transformation $1_S: S\to S$ (the \emph{identity natural transformation} on $S$) that assigns every object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the corresponding identity morphism $1_{S(A)}$.

Natural transformations are composed in a similar manner to morphisms, but they are nevertheless defined as correspondences between both objects and morphisms as shown in the square commutative diagram depicted above. 
%On the other hand, natural transformations can be regarded as functorial morphisms, because they do act as morphisms between functors in the 2-category of small categories that has been defined as a functor category.

 More precisely, given three functors $R,S,T:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$, and two natural transformations, $\tau:R\to S$ and $\eta:S\to T$, we define the composition of $\tau$ with $\eta$, written $\eta \bullet \tau$, as a class of morphisms in $\mathcal{D}$ given by 
$$(\eta\bullet \tau)_A := \eta_A\circ \tau_A,$$ for every object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$.
It is easy to see that $\eta\bullet \tau$ is a natural transformation, since we may ``compose'' two commutative squares and obtain a third one:
$$
\xymatrix@+=4pc{R(A) \ar[d]_{R(\alpha)} \ar[r]^{\tau_A}  & S(A) \ar[d]_{S(\alpha)} \ar[r]^{\eta_A} & T(A) \ar[d]^{T(\alpha)} \ar@{}[dr]|{=} &  
R(A) \ar[d]_{R(\alpha)} \ar[r]^{\eta_A \circ \tau_A} & T(A) \ar[d]^{T(\alpha)} 
\\
R(B) \ar[r]^{\tau_{B}} & S(B) \ar[r]^{\eta_{B}} & T(B) & 
R(B) \ar[r]^{\eta_B \circ \tau_B} & T(B)
}
$$
It is easy to see that the composition ``operation'' on natural transformations is associative:
$$(\zeta\bullet \eta)\bullet \tau = \zeta\bullet (\eta \bullet \tau)$$
for natural transformations $\tau:R\to S$, $\eta:S\to T$, and $\zeta:T\to U$.  In addition, any identity natural transformation acts as a compositional identity: if $\tau:R\to S$ and $\eta:S\to T$, then $$1_S\bullet \tau=\tau \qquad\mbox{ and }\qquad \eta \bullet 1_S = \eta.$$

%This replaces the previous \\
%\textbf{Definition 0.2}:
%A \emph{natural transformation} $\tau: S\dot{\to} T$ is a \emph{function}
%that carries each object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}$ to a morphism
%$\tau_A:S(A)\to T(A)$ of $\mathcal{D}$, and such that for any
%morphism $f:A\to B$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the diagram
%\[
%\xymatrix{& S(A) \ar[d]^{Sf} \ar[r]^{\tau_A} & T(A) \ar[d]^{Tf} \\
%& S(B) \ar[r]^{\tau_{B}} & T(B)
%}
%\]
%is \PMlinkname{commutative}{CommutativeDiagram}.  If every $\tau_A$ happens to be an isomorphism, then $\tau$ is %called a \emph{natural isomorphism}, a \emph{natural equivalence}, or an \emph{isomorphism of functors}.

%which was not either sufficiently general or explicit because it involved \emph{functions} rather than morphisms. \\

\textbf{Remarks}.  
\begin{itemize}
\item
Natural transformations arise frequently in mathematics.  Here's a ``concrete'' example of a natural transformation: the boundary map $H_n(X,A)\to H_{n-1}(A)$ in a homology theory. By definition, every morphism of presheaves is a natural transformation.
More prosaically, the determinant 
$\det:\GL_n\dot{\to}(\ )^*$
is natural.
%\item
%In the definition above, if $\eta_A$ is an \emph{isomorphism} for each $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ then we call $\eta$ a \emph{natural equivalence} (or a functor isomorphism, or isomorphism of two functors), which has the obvious inverse denoted as $\eta^{-1}$.
%\item
%If $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\mathcal{U}$-category, then we can also define the \emph{functor category} $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}$; the objects of $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}$ are the functors $T:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$, and the morphisms are the natural transformations $\tau:S\dot{\to} T$.  The composition of two composable functions which are natural transformations is again a natural transformation, and so $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}$ is a category.
\item
Natural transformations are sometimes called also \emph{functorial morphisms} especially in applications related to the category theory development line pursued by Charles Ehresmann and the `Nicolas Bourbaki' group; this is also a natural translation of the same concept from French, viz. (ref. \cite{CE1965}).
