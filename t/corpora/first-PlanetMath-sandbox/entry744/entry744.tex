A \emph{regular space} is a topological space
in which points and closed sets can be separated by open sets;
in other words, given a closed set $A$ and a point $x\notin A$,
there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x\in U$ and $A\subseteq V$.

A \emph{$\T_3$ space} is a regular \PMlinkname{$\T_0$-space}{T0Space}.
A $\T_3$ space is necessarily also $\T_2$, that is, Hausdorff.

Note that some authors make the opposite distinction between
$\T_3$ spaces and regular spaces,
that is, they define $\T_3$ spaces to be topological spaces
in which points and closed sets can be separated by open sets,
and then define regular spaces to be topological spaces
that are both $\T_3$ and $\T_0$.
(With these definitions, $\T_3$ does not imply $\T_2$.)
