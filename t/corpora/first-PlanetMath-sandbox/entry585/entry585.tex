If an hexagon $ADBFCE$ (not necessarily convex) is inscribed into a conic (in particular into a circle), then the points of intersections of opposite sides
($AD$ with $FC$, $DB$with $CE$ and $BF$ with $EA$) are collinear. This line is called the \emph{Pascal line} of the hexagon.

A very special case happens when the conic degenerates into two lines, however the theorem still holds although this particular case is usually called Pappus theorem.
