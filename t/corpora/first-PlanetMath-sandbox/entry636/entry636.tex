\begin{document}
Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces, $A$ a closed subspace of $X$ and $f,g:X \to Y$ continuous maps. A \emph{homotopy of maps} is a continuous function $F:X \times [0,1] \to Y$ satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F(x,0)=f(x)$ for all $x \in X$
\item $F(x,1)=g(x)$ for all $x \in X$
\item $F(x,t)=f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x \in A, t\in [0,1]$.
\end{enumerate}
We say that $f$ is homotopic to $g$ relative to $A$ and denote this by $f \simeq g$ $rel A$. If $A=\emptyset$, this can be written $f \simeq g$. If $g$ is the constant map (i.e. $g(x)=y$  for all $x \in X$), then we say that $f$ is \emph{nullhomotopic}.
