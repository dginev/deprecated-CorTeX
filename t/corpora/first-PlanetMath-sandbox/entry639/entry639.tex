\begin{document}
For any group $G$, the {\em group ring} $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ is defined to be the ring whose additive group is the abelian group of formal integer linear combinations of elements of $G$, and whose multiplication operation is defined by multiplication in $G$, extended $\mathbb{Z}$--linearly to $\mathbb{Z}[G]$.

More generally, for any ring $R$, the {\em group ring} of $G$ over $R$ is the ring $R[G]$ whose additive group is the abelian group of formal $R$--linear combinations of elements of $G$, i.e.:
$$
R[G] := \left\{\left. \sum_{i=1}^n r_i g_i\ \right|\ r_i \in R,\ g_i \in G\right\},
$$
and whose multiplication operation is defined by $R$--linearly extending the group multiplication operation of $G$. In the case where $K$ is a field, the group ring $K[G]$ is usually called a {\em group algebra}.
