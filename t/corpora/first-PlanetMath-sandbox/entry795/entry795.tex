Let $(X, \borel, \mu)$ be a measure space.  A condition holds \emph{almost everywhere} on $X$ if it holds ``with probability $1$,'' i.e. if it holds everywhere except for a subset of $X$ with measure $0$.  For example, let $f$ and $g$ be nonnegative functions on $X$.  Suppose we want a sufficient condition on functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ such that the relation
\begin{equation}
\int_{X} f d\mu(x) \le \int_{X} g d\mu(x) 
\end{equation}
holds.  Certainly $f(x)\leq g(x)$ for all $x\in X$ is a sufficient condition, but in fact it's enough to have $f(x)\leq g(x)$ almost surely on $X$.  In fact, we can loosen the above non-negativity condition to only require that $f$ and $g$ are almost surely nonnegative as well.

If $X = [0,1]$, then $g$ might be less than $f$ on the Cantor set, an uncountable set with measure $0$, and still satisfy the condition.  We say that $f \le g$ almost everywhere (often abbreviated \emph{a.e.}).   

Note that this \PMlinkescapetext{term} is the \PMlinkescapetext{equivalent} of the \PMlinkescapetext{term} ``almost surely'' from probabilistic measure \PMlinkescapetext{theory}.
