\begin{document}
The \emph{radius} of a circle or sphere is the distance from the center of the figure to the outer edge (or surface.)  

This definition actually holds in $n$ dimensions; so 4th and 5th and $k$-dimensional ``spheres'' have radii.  Since a circle is really a 2-dimensional sphere, its ``radius'' is merely an instance of the general definition.
