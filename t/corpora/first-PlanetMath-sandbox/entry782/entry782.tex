The term \emph{mapping} is a synonym of \PMlinkname{function}{Function}, although usage patterns suggest that  ``mapping'' is the more generic term.

In a geometric context, the term ``function'' often connotes a mapping whose purpose is to assign values to the elements of its domain. In other words, a function defines a field of values.  By contrast, ``mapping'' has a more geometric connotation, as in ``a mapping of one space to another''.
