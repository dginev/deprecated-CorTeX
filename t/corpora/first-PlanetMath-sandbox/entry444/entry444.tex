\emph{Speedup} is a way to quantify the advantage of using a parallel algorithm over a sequential algorithm.  The speedup $S$ is defined as

$$ S = \frac{R}{P} $$
Where $R$ is the running time of the best available sequential algorithm and $P$ is the running time of the parallel algorithm.  

Ideally, on a system with $N$ processors, the speedup for any algorithm would be $N$.  Amdahl's law deals with the speedup in more realistic situations.
