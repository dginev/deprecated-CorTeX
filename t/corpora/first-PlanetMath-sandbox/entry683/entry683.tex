\begin{document}
A topological space is called {\em quasi-compact} if every open cover of it has a finite subcover.  The distinction \PMlinkescapetext{between} compact spaces and quasi-compact spaces exists because some people insist that a space that is compact must be a Hausdorff space.  This distinction occurs for example in Robin Hartshorne's book {\sl Algebraic Geometry\/}.
