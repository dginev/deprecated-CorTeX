\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}
\begin{document}
Synonym of {\em mapping} and {\em function}.  Often used to refer to mappings where the domain and 
codomain are the same set, i.e. one can compose a transformation with itself.  For example, when one 
speaks of {\em transformation of a space}, one refers to some deformation/rearrangement of that space.
