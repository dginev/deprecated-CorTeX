\begin{defn}
Let $A$ and $B$ be integers such that $(A,B)=1$ with $AB\neq \pm 1$. A prime $p$ is called a \emph{primitive divisor} of $A^n-B^n$ if $p$ divides $A^n-B^n$ but $A^m-B^m$ is not divisible by $p$ for all positive integers $m$ that are less than $n$.
\end{defn}

Or, more generally:

\begin{defn}
Let $A$ and $B$ be algebraic integers in a number field $K$ such that $(A,B)=1$ and $A/B$ is not a root of unity. A prime ideal $\wp$ of $K$ is called a \emph{primitive divisor} of $A^n-B^n$ if $\wp|A^n-B^n$ but $\wp \nmid A^m-B^m$ for all positive integers $m$ that are less than $n$.
\end{defn}

The following theorem is due to A. Schinzel (see \cite{sch}):

\begin{thm}
Let $A$ and $B$ be as before. There is an effectively computable constant $n_0$, depending only on the degree of the algebraic number $A/B$, such that $A^n-B^n$ has a primitive divisor for all $n>n_0$.
\end{thm}

By putting $B=1$ we obtain the following corollary:

\begin{cor}
Let $A\neq 0,\pm 1$ be an integer. There exists a number $n_0$ such that $A^n-1$ has a primitive divisor for all $n>n_0$. In particular, for all but finitely many integers $n$, there is a prime $p$ such that the multiplicative order of $A$ modulo $p$ is exactly $n$.
\end{cor}
