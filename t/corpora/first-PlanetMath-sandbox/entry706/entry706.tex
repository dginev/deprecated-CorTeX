\begin{thm}[Eisenstein criterion]
Let $f$ be a primitive polynomial over a commutative unique factorization domain $R$, say
$$f(x)=a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \ldots + a_nx^n \;.$$
If $R$ has an irreducible element $p$ such that
$$p\mid a_m \qquad 0\le m\le n-1$$
$$p^2 \nmid a_0$$
$$p \nmid a_n$$
then $f$ is irreducible.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Suppose
$$f=(b_0 + \ldots + b_s x^s)(c_0 + \ldots + c_t x^t)$$
where $s>0$ and $t>0$. Since $a_0 = b_0 c_0$, we know that $p$ divides one but not both of $b_0$ and $c_0$; suppose $p \mid c_0$. By hypothesis, not all the $c_m$ are divisible by $p$; let $k$ be the smallest index such that $p\nmid c_k$. We have $a_k = b_0 c_k + b_1 c_{k-1} + \ldots + b_k c_0$.
We also have $p\mid a_k$, and $p$ divides every summand except one on the right side, which yields a contradiction. QED
