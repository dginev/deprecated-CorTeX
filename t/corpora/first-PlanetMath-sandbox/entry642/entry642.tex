\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ a subspace of $X$. Suppose there is a continuous map $f:X \to Y$ and a homotopy of maps $F: A \times I \to Y$. The inclusion map $i: A \to X$ is said to have the \emph{homotopy extension property} if there exists a continuous map $F^{'}$ such that the following diagram commutes:
$$
\SelectTips{eu}{}
\xymatrix{
& A \ar[d]^{i} \ar[r]^{i_{0}} & A \times I \ar[d]^{F} \ar@/^1.5pc/[dd]^{i \times id_{I}} \\
& X \ar[r]^{f} \ar[dr]^{i_{0}} & Y \\
& &  X \times I \ar[u]_{F^{'}} 
}
$$
Here, $i_0=(x,0)$ for all $ x \in X$.
