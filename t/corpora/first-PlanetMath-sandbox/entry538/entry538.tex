A {\em filtration} is a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ with
$$
A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \cdots \subset A_n.
$$
If one considers the sets $A_1, \dots, A_n$ as elements of a larger set which are partially ordered by inclusion, then a filtration is simply a finite chain with respect to this partial ordering. It should be noted that in some contexts the word ``filtration'' may also be employed to describe an infinite chain.
