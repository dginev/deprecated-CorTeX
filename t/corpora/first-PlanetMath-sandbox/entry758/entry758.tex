\begin{document}
A \emph{Hilbert space} is an inner product space which is \PMlinkid{complete}{603} under the \PMlinkescapetext{induced} metric.

In particular, a Hilbert space is a Banach space in the norm \PMlinkescapetext{induced} by the inner product, since the norm and the inner product both induce the same metric.  Any finite-dimensional inner product space is a Hilbert space, but it is worth mentioning that some authors require the space to be infinite dimensional for it to be called a Hilbert space.
