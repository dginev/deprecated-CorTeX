A \emph{topological group} is a triple $(G,\cdot,\mathcal{T})$ where $(G,\cdot)$ is a group and $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology on $G$ such that under $\mathcal{T}$, the group operation $(x,y)\mapsto x\cdot y$ is continuous with respect to the product topology on $G\times G$ and the inverse map $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ is continuous on $G$.

Many authors require that the topology be Hausdorff.
