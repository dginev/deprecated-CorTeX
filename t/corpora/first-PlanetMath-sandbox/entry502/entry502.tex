\section{Pivoting}

Pivoting is a process performed on a matrix in order to improve numerical stability.

\emph{Partial pivoting} of an $n \times n$ matrix is the sorting of the rows of the matrix so that row $i$ contains the maximum absolute column value for column $i$, among all rows $i, \ldots, n$. That is, we begin by swapping row 1 with the row that has the largest absolute value for the first column, then swap row 2 with the row that has the largest magnitude for the second column (among rows 2 and below), and so on.

\emph{Complete pivoting} is a reordering of both rows and columns, using the same method as above.  It is usually not necessary to ensure numerical stability.

Pivoting can be represented as multiplication by permutation matrices.
