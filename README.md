======

A general purpose processing framework for **Cor**pora of **TeX** documents

 * Distributive processing via Gearman
 * A flexible array of backends for Document, Annotation and Task provenance.
 * Open set of supported representations
 * Automatic dependency management of registered Services
 * Powerful workflow management and development support through the CorTeX web interface
 * Supports multi-corpora multi-service installations

History:
 * Builds on the expertise developed during the [arXMLiv project](http://trac.kwarc.info/arXMLiv) at Jacobs University. 
 * In particular, CorTeX is a successor to the [build system](http://arxmliv.kwarc.info) developed by Heinrich Stamerjohanns.
 * The architecture tiered towards generic processing of conversion, analysis and aggregation services was motivated by the [LLaMaPUn](http://trac.kwarc.info/LaMaPUn)
   project at Jacobs University.
 * The messaging conventions are motivated by work on [LaTeXML](http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML)'s log reports with Bruce Miller.
