Admin interface monitors/controls the system:

== Blank slate
 -- empty corpus
 -- empty 0 x 0 job landscape

== Initialization
 1. Register a corpus/resource
 2. Register services("blackboard modules") per corpus!

We have an M x N x C job landscape, for M services and N corpus entries in C corpora.
Job status Codes:
0 ready for processing
-1 done
-2 missing dependencies
JOBID > 0  incomplete/processing

== Cron processing
 1. If we have space in our cron queue 
  1.1. Grab next non-completed job or sleep.
  1.2. Pass job on to Gearman for work, record job ID in queue.
 2. Check if job is completed, register in DB.


Gearman could in fact take charge of most of the cron problems -- just hit it with jobs.

== Third-party service registrations
 - validate all mandatory fields, good UI
 - have a mandatory testbed sandbox - one article from each corpus? total 5?
  the developer can only deploy on an entire corpus once the test bed has finished with non-error results (5 out of 5)
  and the developer manually confirms they are happy with the annotations.
