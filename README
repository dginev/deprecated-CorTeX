CorTeX Framework

The SVN tries to be self-contained, but many of the bundled components may, and even should, be deployed separately.

This README should grow into a full-blown system documentation in doc/, as well as an installation summary at INSTALL.

Currently, the system contains of:

I. Frontend:

I.1. webserver/cortex-server.pl - the main frontend web app
I.2. webserver/


II. Backends:

WAR Files download links (just in case the war/ files don't work out):

II.1. OWLIM
http://download.ontotext.com/owlim/3e4dc2e0-d66c-11e1-b81b-dba586cc0cc6/owlim-lite-5.2.5331.zip

II.2. Exist
http://sourceforge.net/projects/exist/files/Stable/1.2/eXist-1.2.6-rev9165.war/download 

As the size of the data grows, one should consider deploying on several machines, as well as federated/distributed setups.
The default deployment is monolithic.
